# SjD Analysis Project

This repository supports a Sjögren's disease (SjD) analysis workflow.
It is meant to keep the project organized from raw data to final tables and figures.

## Project goal

Analyze patient data, prepare clean datasets, and generate reproducible results for reporting.

## Main workflow

1. Store original files in `data/raw/`.
2. Prepare analysis-ready data with the project scripts.
3. Save intermediate files in `data/intermediate/` when needed.
4. Save final datasets in `data/analytic/`.
5. Export tables, figures, and logs to `outputs/`.

## Key folders

- `data/`: project data files
- `src/`: analysis and processing scripts
- `outputs/`: generated results

## Important note

Do not edit the original raw data. Keep all changes reproducible through scripts.
